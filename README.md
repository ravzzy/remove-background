# Remove Background via AI

A simple web-based application that removes image backgrounds using AI. It utilizes TensorFlow.js and a pre-trained **U-2-Net** deep learning model to process images directly in the browser.

### ðŸš€ Features  
- Drag-and-drop or file upload support  
- AI-powered background removal using **U-2-Net**  
- Downloadable processed image  
- Responsive UI with progress indicators  

### ðŸ§  AI Model  
This project is built on top of the **U-2-Net** model by [xuebinqin](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net), which provides high-quality image segmentation for background removal. The model is converted for TensorFlow.js and runs entirely in the browser.  

### ðŸ“‚ Installation & Local Testing  
To run this locally, you can use Pythonâ€™s built-in HTTP server:  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/background-remover.git
   cd background-remover
   ```  

2. **Start a Local Server**  
   - Using Python 3:  
     ```sh
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```  
   - Using Python 2:  
     ```sh
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
     ```  

3. **Open in Browser**  
   Navigate to:  
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### ðŸ“Œ Notes  
- Ensure `models/model.json` and related files are in the correct path for AI processing.  
- Works best in modern browsers with WebGL support.
